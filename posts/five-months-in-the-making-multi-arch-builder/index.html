<p>If you have been following along, you are probably asking &ldquo;What took so long?&rdquo; and I totally understand.
I had no idea what was wrong before today.
My scripts had been working for over a year, then just stopped.
I had removed a bunch of the debug info from the logs, which didn&rsquo;t help the situation at all.</p>

<p>The Paketo team continues to put a high priority on ARM64 and multi-architecture tools/buildpacks.
I had created several ARM64 workarounds over the years.
The Paketo team continued improving their tools to support ARM64 as well.
I was not doing a good job of pulling the tooling changes from upstream.
So my workarounds were breaking the build.</p>

</h2>
<p>I had made several solid attempts at resolving the issues.
I just kept getting distracted with other priorities.
I have had this process working on multiple environments.
Every version of my pipeline seemed to be broken in a slightly different way.
They were, because of my workarounds.
I had different workarounds for different environments.</p>

<p>This year, I&rsquo;ve been traveling more than ever.
In fact, I&rsquo;m on my way to Oracle Cloud World 2023, right now.
The laptop that I was using for work, wasn&rsquo;t keeping up with what I was needing to deliver, to the community.
My conference sessions were having issues, my customer sessions were also having issues.
Watching for over 4-minutes, for a native compile, isn&rsquo;t great for anyone.
So I requested a new M1 laptop.
When I got home on Friday, my new laptop had arrived.
Since I&rsquo;m going to be working on an M1 from now on, I needed to have all the fast builds.
I needed to make sure all of my demos work on the new hardware.
I also needed to be ready to use Java 21 when it comes out in 2 days.
In addition to my new laptop from work, my Ampere Dev Kit server also arrived.
The server had been stuck in US Customs for a couple of months, after arriving from China.
It was my first time working with US Customs.</p>
<ul>
<li>M1</li>
<li>Ampere Dev Kit</li>
<li>Java 21</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-work">

  </a>
</h2>
<p>On my new M1, I simply started adding in debug info to the scripts.
It felt good to get back into the process and remind myself how it all worked.
When things work, you don&rsquo;t need to keep the details in your mental cache.
The upstream builder added a few buildpacks.
Packaging the newer buildpacks is where the problems were.
Moments ago, I was getting ready to board when my tests passed.
The KC Chiefs were playing Jacksonville at the same time.
When I shouted with excitement, the people around me assumed that I was watching the game.
I love my job.
I love what I do.
I could hear the Chiefs game, but getting this build to work was even more exciting that watching the Chiefs win the Super Bowl, twice.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember what the number was, from the last time I looked at the stats on Docker Hub.
When I went to look today, I was hoping for it to be over 2000.
Maybe 3000?  Is 5000 possible?
My goosebumps hit when I saw that it was over 8500!
I am so excited that people are using it.</p>

<p>I am going to try to move away from my scripts, towards what the Paketo team is doing.
I want to get my version moved over to the <a href="https://github.com/paketo-community"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paketo-community</a> repository.
Hopefully, from there, it will be even closer to being merged upstream.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
