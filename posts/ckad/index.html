<p>Last Friday, I attempted the CKAD exam.
I had studied for weeks and was trying to pass before November 1st.
I went way too slow.
I only answered 10 of the 19 questions completely.
I left 5 questions completely unanswered.
I tried to pay attention to the weights of each question, so there was a chance that I was going to pass.
I answered all of the highest weight questions.
My friends, who had already taken the test, told me that I would get my results the following night, around midnight.
The wait was brutal, all day Saturday I was checking my email, not knowing how I did.
I was hoping, but not confident.
I got the email shortly after midnight on Sunday morning.
Unfortunately I only scored 61% and needed 66% to pass.</p>
<p>I immediately rescheduled my retake exam before going to bed.
Before falling asleep, I figured I would have four blocks, of two hours, to study more and practice going faster.
I didn&rsquo;t get to study during any of the blocks that I thought I would have.
Instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>One 1-hour session on Monday</li>
<li>One 2-hour session on Tuesday</li>
<li>Two 30-min sessions on Wednesday morning</li>
</ul>
<p>I took the test again on Wednesday afternoon (yesterday) and this time I feel much better.
I answered 17 questions completely.
The questions that I didn&rsquo;t answer completely had weights of 2% and 3% and I think I had partial answers.
I think it is very possible that I get above 90%, but I will definitely be happy with 66% too!
My confidence is high, and I&rsquo;m going to have a celebratory lunch today, even though I don&rsquo;t know for sure that I passed.</p>
<p>Looking back, I realized that I learned the most while I was pairing with a teammate, Sean.
We had a couple of Zoom sessions where we just talked about our approaches, while we worked through exercises.
As I continue to wait for my results, I&rsquo;m looking foward to studying for the CKA exam.
I will definitely do more pairing as I prepare for the CKA exam.
My perception today is that I had 2x-3x more value per minute, while I was pairing, compared to just following the online training material.
I&rsquo;ll still use online training for the CKA, but I am already scheduling time to pair before I have actually started the new course.</p>
<p>My previous experience with kubernetes definitely helped me get through.
It was very clear to me that I have been spoiled by Cloud Foundry.
To me, kubernetes is a step back from what I&rsquo;ve been doing for years, and that was painful.
I would still like to explore more of the kubernetes ecosystem, like Helm.
I&rsquo;m glad that I&rsquo;ve got this experience under my belt, even though I don&rsquo;t know if I passed yet.</p>
<p>Lastly, now that I&rsquo;m in this mode of studying and practicing, I think I&rsquo;m going to stay in this mode for the next 60-90 days at least.</p>
